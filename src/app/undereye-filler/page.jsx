            <h3>What is Under-Eye Filler?</h3>
            <p>
              Under-eye filler, also known as tear trough filler, is a
              hyaluronic acid-based injectable used to treat hollowing, shadows,
              and dark circles beneath the eyes. At Divaa Beauty Clinic, we use
              advanced cannula techniques to gently restore volume and achieve a
              smoother, more rested appearance.

            <summary>Is under-eye filler safe?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes â€” when performed by experienced providers using proper
              technique and product selection. We use cannulas to reduce
              bruising and improve safety.

            <summary>How long does it last?</summary>
            <p>
              Results typically last 9-12 months, though some clients may see
              longer-lasting results in this area due to low movement.
